# StudentAffairsManagmentSystem_Angular
It is a data-driven web application that was specifically designed to automate every single part of the academic process as a full management system for my faculty that follows the credit-hours system.

The project has three sub-systems:
-Mapping System: maps the college structure (departments, programs hierarchy, majors, ...etc.) to our project to work according to the college structure constraints.
-Academics System: allows the students to choose what to register from their available courses, programs, and track their academic progress until they graduate using a fully-automated grading system.
-Admin Panel: allows the system admin to manage the users (students, staff) and their permissions, monitor their activity in the system, â€¦etc.
